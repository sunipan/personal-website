# My personal website

I built this website using Next.js, React, and Tailwind and then deployed it on Vercel.

## Animations

To achieve the scrolling animations, I used GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) which is a package with many utilities for animating elements in JavaScript. Some of its features are paid, but the ScrollTrigger plugin I used on the website is free.
